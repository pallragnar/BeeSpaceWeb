            <p>
                Polykite Games is an Icelandic independent games studio dedicated to creating playful worlds
                with emotional depth and technical craft. We explore games as spaces for wonder,
                storytelling, and joy. <br>
                Lead by 2 veterans, each with over a decade of experience in AAA. The team is super excited about

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that small teams can make big experiences. Our approach combines
                    experimentation with a strong artistic vision, focusing on meaning as much as
                    mechanics.

                <p>
                    Our upcoming title, <em>Bee Space</em>, invites players to explore a world
                    abandoned by people through the eyes of the bees themselves.
                    Bee Space is a cozy, roguelike, deckbuilder where you guide curious Space Bees
                    as they regrow tiny islands on Earth.

                <h2>A Cozy Deckbuilder</h2>
                <p>
                    Partner with different bees on your campaign to regrow Earth. Every new Bee partner brings a new
                    story as well as new mechanics. Bee Space has been designed to be accessible while offering
                    strategic depth. The game has constructiveness at its core and contains no violence.
